Developed a simple RESTful API to manage accounts and transactions.
#PHP version 8.1
#Laravel version 10.10

#Install on local host
1. Download files
2. Create a database in MySQL
3. Add the database name in the ENV file
4. Run the migration command - (php artisan migrate)
5. You can find the Task-Accounts.postman_collection.json file and import this JSON in Postman 
6. All the API will work fine.
7. I have used the sanctum token, so once you are done logging in, pass the token in the header
